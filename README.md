#   ðŸ“‰ LINEAR STATS
##  DESCRIPTION
The program is be able to read from a file. In other words, the program is be able to read the data present in the path passed as argument. The data in the file will be presented as below:

```console
189
113
121
114
145
110
...
```

This data represents a graph in which the values of the x axis are the number of the lines (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ...) and the values of the y axis are the actual numbers (189, 113, 121, 114, 145, 110...).

After reading the file, the program prints the `Linear Regression Line` and the `Pearson Correlation Coefficient` in the following format:

```console
Linear Regression Line: y = <value>x + <value>
Pearson Correlation Coefficient: <value>
```

##  USAGE

```console
node main.js <file_path>
```
